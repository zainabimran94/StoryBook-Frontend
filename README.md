## üåê Backend Services  
The backend architecture integrates C# and Python services to ensure seamless communication and efficient processing of user requests:  
- **C# API**:  
  - Manages user authentication, preferences, and interactions with the PostgreSQL database.  
  - Acts as the intermediary between the frontend and the Python AI service.  
  - Receives user preferences from the frontend and forwards them to the Python AI service via **HTTP client**.  
  - Handles the response from Python, including AI-generated titles, images, and stories, and sends the final data back to the frontend.  
  - GitHub Repository: [StoryBook C# Backend](https://github.com/zainabimran94/StoryBook-c-.git)  

- **Python AI Service**:  
  - Processes data received from the C# API to generate personalized story content.  
  - **Gemini API**: Utilized for creating engaging story titles and narratives.  
  - **Flux.dev AI**: Generates custom story images based on user preferences.  
  - Sends the generated data (titles, stories, and images) back to the C# API via **HTTP client**.  
  - GitHub Repository: [StoryBook Python Backend](https://github.com/zainabimran94/StoryBook-Python.git)
